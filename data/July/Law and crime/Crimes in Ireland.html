         , arrive in Ireland with the intention to rape and murder one woman a week. Their first victim was Elizabeth Plunkett, a 23-year-old woman who was raped by both men before Shaw choked her to death with a shirt sleeve on Evans' orders. They were fearful that she could identify them if left alive, as had previously been the case while the men were committing sex crimes in England. The pair then moved on to 24-year-old chef Mary Duffy, who Shaw smothered with a cushion after she was raped by both men. Both were later convicted for the brutal murders and became Ireland's longest serving prisoners; Evans died at age 69 in 2012.

Police soon discover multiple holes in Whelan's version of events and it quickly becomes clear that he had strangled his wife in cold blood. Whelan, who had previously been responsible for the death of his 61-year-old neighbour Elizabeth Murphy in 1997 when he accidentally crashed his car into hers, faked his suicide and fled to Spain, where he worked as a barman until an Irish tourist recognized him. Whelan was extradited back to Ireland and sentenced for the calculated murder of his wife.
